# A turn-based battle game, set to a Star Wars theme.
Click to get started, where you're able to choose which character you'd like to play as.
You are then prompted to choose an oponent. Battle them until one of you runs out of health.
If you run out of health, the game is over.
If your opponent runs out of health, they fade away and you are prompted to choose your next opponent.
Click the button to attack. Your opponent will counter-attack before you have the chance to attack them again.
All players have different health, different attack power, and different counter-attack power. Your player's attack power will increase every time you attack.
It is possible to win with any player. Good luck! [Play the game here](https://jcutlah.github.io/star-wars-rpg/)
